L-BFGS

Software for Large-scale Unconstrained Optimization by Jorge Nocedal

L-BFGS is a limited-memory quasi-Newton code for unconstrained
optimization. The code has been developed at the Optimization Center,
a joint venture of Argonne National Laboratory and Northwestern
University.  Downloading and Installing L-BFGS
